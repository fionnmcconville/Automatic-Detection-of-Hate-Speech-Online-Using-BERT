    "However there are far more tweet databases that can be used to further-pretrain my BERT model. There is a wealth of unsupervised tweet datasets online that I can make use of, these datasets often do not come in text form but rather the tweets are represented by their tweet IDs. Below I will describe the tweet datasets and retrieve their associated text using the tweepy module."

    "Using as wide a variety of sources as possible, we will increase the knowledge of our further-pretrained model. My goal when sourcing these datasets was to try and find tweet datasets which are largely user-generated, as hate speech online largely comes from user generated content.\n",
    "\n",
    "If I could find it, I would use tweet datasets likely to have aggressive or abusive content as well as possibly containing sexist and racial slurs. Even having some tweets just talking about racial, gender or sexuality based issues would be beneficial for my model to be trained on as these tweets use the language associated with these issues.\n",

Lee in Emancipation Park, which itself was renamed from Lee Park two months earlier. Protesters included white supremacists, white nationalists, neo-Confederates, neo-Nazis, and militias. This dataset contains 200,113 tweet ids collected with the #unitetheright hashtag. The time ranges for the tweets are from 2017-08-04 11:44:12 to 2017-08-15 16:03:30 GMT.\n",

The tweets were collected on 01/05/2017. After the video surfaced, the Twitter hashtag, #BLMkidnapping, was created and used to incorrectly attribute the violent attack to members of the Black Lives Matter movement. Police in Chicago, where the attack took place, have found no evidence the attack has any connection to the Black Lives Matter movement.

Whilst many tweets to Ms. Ocasio-Cortez may be glowing praise, I'm counting on a sizable portion of the tweets directed at her to be abusive and perhaps sexist and racist - I feel like this is a safe enough hypothesis, as America's political climate has become much more toxic in recent years.\n"

    "# Removing common terms for word-masking\n",
    "It has occured to me that in the way these tweet datasets were sourced - (by filtering through a particular term/hashtag via twitter API), there will be recurring terms or hashtags in each sequence - which may be counter-productive to the word masking excercise later in further BERT pre-training. \n",
    "\n",
    "<i>(Also though, removing these terms may render some sequences non-sensical - however I'm not sure how concerining this might be from an NLP standpoint) </i>\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore I'll develop a function to remove these common terms from my tweet data. These terms can be often followed by punctuation. So I'll fill an initial list with the terms I'd like to remove, then from that I'll create an augmented list which contains all the terms, plus versions of them with punctuation at the end.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<i> (I'll do further pre-training on data that has had common terms removed, as well as data that hasn't - and instead hashtags are segmented to mitigate the commonality of terms) </i>\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll convert this list into a set at the end of the function, as a set is much quicker to access than a list - which will be useful later on"
