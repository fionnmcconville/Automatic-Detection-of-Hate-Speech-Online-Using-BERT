    "# Assembling and Inspecting Potential Data for my Hate Speech Detection Model\n",
    "This is the initial stage of my project where I will assemble as much hate speech data as possible to fine-tune the pre-trained BERT model so that it can accurately classify hate speech on twitter.\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope below I have demonstrated that I've taken great care in choosing what data I decide to train my model, as I've manually inspected the data sources online and decided for myself, (as well as having the informal help of my friends), whether a dataset has accurately annotated for hate speech or not based on the below definition. \n",
    "\n",
    "> <i>Hate Speech is commonly defined as any communication that disparages a person or a group on the basis of some characteristic such as race, colour, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, religion, or other characteristics.</i>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I've been careful to do this because I didn't want to confuse my model by providing it with vastly differing interpretations of what constitutes hate speech.\n",
    "\n",
    "The need for accurate and reliable hate speech detection online is very important, many online have lamentated the over-zealous nature of social media companies curtailing free speech and punishing users for speech that is offensive - but not hate speech under common law. Therefore I've been cautious to try and limit false positive annotation in the data below carefully"

    "(B) subtask_b: <b>Categorization of offense types</b>\n",

    "- `(IND) Individual` - The target of the offensive post is an individual: a famous person, a named individual or an unnamed person interacting in the conversation.\n",
    "- `(GRP) Group` - The target of the offensive post is a group of people considered as a unity due to the same ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation, political affiliation, religious belief, or something else.\n",
