also I'm aware that while the need for accurate hate speech detection online is very important, many online have lamentated the over-zealous nature of social media companies curtailing free speech and punishing users for speech that is offensive -

    "- (OFF) Offensive - This post contains offensive language or a targeted (veiled or direct) offense\n",
    "\n",
    "In our annotation, we label a post as offensive (OFF) if it contains any form of non-acceptable language (profanity) or a targeted offense, which can be veiled or direct. \n",

    "(B) Level B: Automatic categorization of offense types\n",
    "\n",
    "- (TIN) Targeted Insult and Threats - A post containing an insult or threat to an individual, a group, or others (see categories in sub-task C).\n",
    "- (UNT) Untargeted - A post containing non-targeted profanity and swearing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Posts containing general profanity are not targeted, but they contain non-acceptable language.\n",
    "\n",
    "(C) Level C: Offense target identification\n",

    "- (IND) Individual - The target of the offensive post is an individual: a famous person, a named individual or an unnamed person interacting in the conversation.\n",
    "- (GRP) Group - The target of the offensive post is a group of people considered as a unity due to the same ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation, political affiliation, religious belief, or something else.\n",
