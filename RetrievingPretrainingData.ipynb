There is a wealth of unsupervised tweet datasets online that I can make use of, these datasets often do not come in text form but rather the tweets are represented by their tweet IDs. Below I will describe the tweet datasets and retrieve their associated text using the tweepy module."

    "If I could find it, I would use tweet datasets likely to have aggressive or abusive content as well as possibly containing sexist and racial slurs.

Lee in Emancipation Park, which itself was renamed from Lee Park two months earlier. Protesters included white supremacists, white nationalists, neo-Confederates, neo-Nazis, and militias. This dataset contains 200,113 tweet ids collected with the #unitetheright hashtag. The time ranges for the tweets are from 2017-08-04 11:44:12 to 2017-08-15 16:03:30 GMT.\n",

After the video surfaced, the Twitter hashtag, #BLMkidnapping, was created and used to incorrectly attribute the violent attack to members of the Black Lives Matter movement. Police in Chicago, where the attack took place, have found no evidence the attack has any connection to the Black Lives Matter movement.

    "The next couple of cells are containing very large tweet ID datasets. I'm not sure if I'll be able to retrieve all of the tweets in one session as it takes so long, also converting a very large dataframe to a json via pandas throws a MemoryError\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll slightly alter the previous lookup_tweets function to checkpoint by saving the tweet text to a designated google bucket file path after however many IDs have been fetched\n",
    "\n",
    "These datasets - while they have a much larger volume than the others - have less desirable tweets to my pretraining than the other datasets. For one, these datasets are likely to have more non-user generated tweets and possibly spam as they're based on huge movements or global issues, unlike the niche subjects before.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the immigration executive order tweets are much more difficult to anticipate what common terms to remove from the tweets that might affect the learning of the word-masking task (for example in the #Chalkening tweets I'll remove #chalkening from each tweet because the model could just learn that #chalkening is likely to be the missing word in each sequence, just because it comes up in each tweet).\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, I'll not use all of the tweets from each of these sets, but rather a sample. Still, I might as well retrieve as many as I can, in case my strategy changes later and I find that the more tweets I do further pre-training on the better my model performs."

    "# Removing common terms for word-masking\n",
    "It has occured to me that in the way these tweet datasets were sourced - (by filtering through a particular term/hashtag via twitter API), there will be recurring terms or hashtags in each sequence - which may be counter-productive to the word masking excercise later in further BERT pre-training. \n",

    "<i>(Also though, removing these terms may render some sequences non-sensical - however I'm not sure how concerining this might be from an NLP standpoint) </i>\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore I'll develop a function to remove these common terms from my tweet data. These terms can be often followed by punctuation. So I'll fill an initial list with the terms I'd like to remove, then from that I'll create an augmented list which contains all the terms, plus versions of them with punctuation at the end.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<i> (I'll do further pre-training on data that has had common terms removed, as well as data that hasn't - and instead hashtags are segmented to mitigate the commonality of terms) </i>\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll convert this list into a set at the end of the function, as a set is much quicker to access than a list - which will be useful later on"
