There is a wealth of unsupervised tweet datasets online that I can make use of, these datasets often do not come in text form but rather the tweets are represented by their tweet IDs. Below I will describe the tweet datasets and retrieve their associated text using the tweepy module."

Lee in Emancipation Park, which itself was renamed from Lee Park two months earlier. Protesters included white supremacists, white nationalists, neo-Confederates, neo-Nazis, and militias.

After the video surfaced, the Twitter hashtag, #BLMkidnapping, was created and used to incorrectly attribute the violent attack to members of the Black Lives Matter movement. Police in Chicago, where the attack took place, have found no evidence the attack has any connection to the Black Lives Matter movement.
